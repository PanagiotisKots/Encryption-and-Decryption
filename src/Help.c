"Claude Shannon later applied Boolean algebra to electronic circuits, paving the way for binary representation in digital systems.\n"
"Binary encoding forms the basis of digital computing and information storage. In a binary system, each bit (0 or 1) represents the most basic unit of information,\n"
"allowing for efficient data processing and storage.\n"
"In binary, each digit's place value is a power of 2. The rightmost bit is 2^0, the next is 2^1, and so on. \n"

"Base64 encoding originated from the need to transmit binary data over systems that were designed to handle only text data.\n "
"It has been a part of various internet protocols, including MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) for email attachments, \n"
"and is widely used in encoding data for data storage and transmission. It is used for encoding data such as images, audio files, and other binary formats, \n"
"making it suitable for data transmission over text-based protocols like email or HTML. Base64 encoding groups binary data \n into sets of 24 bits (3 bytes) and represents each group as four ASCII characters. "
"This is achieved by dividing the binary data into six-bit chunks, each corresponding to one of the 64 possible values in the Base64 character set.\n"
"While Base64 is not an encryption method per se, it is often used to encode binary data before transmission or storage. \n"

"AES is a widely accepted and extensively used encryption standard.\n"
"AES is a symmetric key encryption algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. \n"
"It operates on fixed-size blocks of data (128 bits), making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from securing communications to encrypting files.\n"
"AES operates on blocks of data using a series of transformations, including substitution (SubBytes), permutation (ShiftRows), mixing (MixColumns), and key addition (AddRoundKey).\n"
"These operations are based on finite field mathematics, providing a high level of security.\n"
"Encryption Process:\n"
"1. Key Expansion: The original key is expanded into a set of round keys.\n"

"2. Initial Hash Values: A set of constant initial hash values is defined (8 hash values for SHA-256).\n"
